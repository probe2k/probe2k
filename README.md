### Deep Learning Engineer | ML Researcher | Linux Enthusiast

I'm a Deep Learning Engineer focused on generative models, computer vision, and large-scale machine learning systems.  

I work across deep learning (GANs, transformers, diffusion models), system optimization, and Linux-based development.

In my spare time, I contribute to open-source projects, develop mobile and web applications, and build custom Linux tools.
